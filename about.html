                </p>
                <p>I am a PhD student at Oxford Brookes University. This website was set up as part of the research, which I began in January 2022.  Initialy the title of the research was Co-creating Equitable and Sustainable Urban Environments using Visualising Technologies, with the visualising technologies referred to being AR and VR. Taking this as a starting point, the research developed through a participatory process, working with people who worked in the planning and design of the built environment and those in community groups connected to the built environment.</p>

                <p>A number of possible directions for the research came up from a questionnaire and one-to-one discussions. Two were chosen; how can VR and AR be delivered for community engagement in planning and how can this be done in a way that fosters trust. Through the questionnaire, discussions and three design workshops some key findings have been developed along with models for managing and funding the AR and VR in a way that fosters trust, as well as different ways that content can be created, and what the visualisations themselves look like.</p>

                <p>This site was created as a resource for people in the built environment interested in using AR and VR for community engagement. The idea came up during the research: by seeing examples and learning about the ways that AR and VR can be made, people might feel more comfortable exploring them for their own projects. </p>

                <p>Once you have looked through the site, if you are happy to fill in a short questionnaire to give feedback that would be greatly appreciated.</p>
