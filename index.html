                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Immersive technologies are tools that add digital elements to real-world spaces or create entirely new digital environments. These technologies can involve visuals, sound, sensations like vibrations or pressure (haptic feedback), and allow you to experience or interact with digital content in new ways. </p>

                    <p>They exist along a spectrum, ranging from those that blend with the real world to those that create fully immersive digital environments, and include:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Augmented Reality (AR):</h3>
                    <p>
                        Adds digital elements to the real world, visible through devices like phones or AR glasses (e.g., placing a virtual object on your desk).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Mixed Reality (MR):</h3>
                    <p>
                        A deeper form of AR where digital objects interact with the physical world in real-time (e.g., a virtual object anchored to your desk that you can manipulate).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Augmented Virtuality (VR):</h3>
                    <p>
                        A form of VR where elements of the real world are brought into the virtual environment (e.g., live video feeds integrated into a VR experience).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Virtual Reality (VR):</h3>
                    <p>
                        Immerses you in a fully digital environment, replacing the real world (e.g., exploring a 3D virtual building with a headset).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Using AR and VR as Umbrella Terms</h3>
                    <p> While these technologies have distinct definitions, they are simplified on this website as follows: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>AR to represent both Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality, as they both involve blending digital content with the physical world.</li>
                        <li>VR to represent both Virtual Reality and Augmented Virtuality, as they primarily focus on immersive, predominantly digital environments.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Introduction to the Project</h2>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p> This research explores how augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) can be used as tools for community engagement in planning. Community engagement in planning involves including community members in the design processes that shape built environments. Adopting a participatory approach in this research allowed stakeholders to guide its direction. Through this collaboration, two key areas emerged: How AR and VR can be delivered for community engagement in planning, and the role of trust when using AR and VR for engagement.</p>
                    <p>Through this collaborative process, initial worries about bias and the risk of misleading AR and VR visuals changed into a bigger focus: understanding how to foster rather than erode trust when AR and VR are used in planning engagement. From these insights, the research developed practical ideas on how AR and VR can be delivered, managed, and created to support open, trustworthy engagement.</p>
                    <p>Key outcomes include different ways to manage and fund AR/VR projects that foster trust, approaches to creating content, and methods for designing visualisations. The research also identified simple, no-code tools for creating AR and VR content, making it more accessible for people with little technical expertise.</p>
