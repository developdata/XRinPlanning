                    <p>It is a resource for communities, researchers, planners, designers, and developers interested in using immersive technologies for community engagement in planning. You can explore various AR and VR examples,and learn about content creation methods that were also part of the research.</p>

                    <p> This research used a participatory approach, allowing stakeholders to shape its direction. While it began with a general focus on using AR and VR as tools for the co-creation of urban environments, engaging community members and professionals in the research brought forward an important area: the role of trust when using these technologies for community engagement in planning.</p>
                    <p>Through this collaborative process, initial worries about bias and the risk of misleading AR and VR visuals changed into a bigger focus: understanding how to foster rather than erode trust when AR and VR are used in planning engagement. From these insights, the research developed practical ideas on how AR and VR can be delivered, managed, and created to support open, trustworthy engagement.</p>
                    <p>Key outcomes include different ways to manage and fund AR/VR projects that foster trust, approaches to creating content, and methods for designing visualisations. The research also identified simple, no-code tools for creating AR and VR content, making it more accessible for people with little technical expertise.</p>
