                </p>
                <p>Through the research, several methods were developed and explored for creating visualisations that aim to foster trust. This page explores two of them.</p>

                <p>VR and AR have reached a stage where they can support different types of community engagement—offering everything from simple visuals to highly accurate and interactive experiences. New tools make it easier to create these experiences without advanced skills, making VR and AR more accessible and adaptable than ever.</p>

                <p>High-quality AR and VR can be developed by external companies, offering detailed visualisations for planning and engagement. Geolocation technology has improved, making AR more accurate for real-world positioning. Specialised companies can create complex immersive experiences that allow people to explore planned developments or future spaces before they’re built, with interactive features and detailed visuals. See the Examples page for illustrations.</p>

                <h3>Creating AR and VR Without Coding</h3>
                <p>Content could also be created more simply without coding. While these tools offer less functionality than professionally developed visualisations, they are good for quick prototyping. The applications to do this include Roblox, Minecraft, Adobe Aero, Snapchat's AR Lens Studio, and Reality Composer.</p>

                <p>Although there is a learning curve—such as the benefit of some 3D knowledge when using tools like Roblox—these platforms enable people without coding skills to create AR and VR visualisations.</p>

                <p>New AI tools make it possible to create 2D images and 3D objects from text descriptions. This could work well to quickly generate ideas and try things out during community enagement.</p>
