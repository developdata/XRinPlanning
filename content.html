                <p>Through the research, several methods were developed and explored for creating visualisations that aim to foster trust. This page explores two of them.</p>

                <p>VR and AR have reached a stage where they can support different types of community engagement—offering everything from simple visuals to highly accurate and interactive experiences. New tools make it easier to create these experiences without advanced skills, making VR and AR more accessible and adaptable than ever.</p>

                <p>High-quality AR and VR can be developed by external companies, offering detailed visualisations for planning and engagement. Geolocation technology has improved, making AR more accurate for real-world positioning. Specialised companies can create complex immersive experiences that allow people to explore planned developments or future spaces before they’re built, with interactive features and detailed visuals. You can see some cases of this on the example page.</p>

                <h3>Creating AR and VR Without Coding</h3>
                <p>Content could also be created more simply without coding. While these tools offer less functionality than professionally developed visualisations, they are good for quick prototyping. Applications to do this include Roblox, Minecraft, Adobe Aero, Snapchat's AR Lens Studio, and Reality Composer.</p>

                <p>Although there is a learning curve—such as the benefit of some 3D knowledge when using tools like Roblox, these platforms enable people without coding skills to create AR and VR visualisations.</p>

                <p>New AI tools make it possible to create 2D images and 3D objects from text descriptions. This could work well to quickly generate ideas and try things out during community enagement.</p>

                <h3>My Experience of Creating Content Simply</h3>
                
                <p>I tried a number of non coding tools for creating AR and VR, thinking about their use for community engagement. Below are some of my thoughts and links to tutorials I used when learning some of the different software for creating AR and VR:</p>
                
                <h4>Roblox</h4>
                <p>Using Roblox can be a relatively simple way to create a VR visualisation. It does have a learning curve and some 3D knowledge is helpful. I found that placing 3D models can be tricky - they don’t always line up or look the same in build mode as they do in play mode. Ready-made 3D models can be used in the scenes, either from the Roblox assets store (avoiding scripted ones for security), or imported. You can create models with software such as Blender and bring those into your scene. Roblox can be used on a Quest VR headset.</p>
                    
                <p>The rendering engine is solid, with good lighting and shadows, and the terrain editor makes it easy to create and edit landscapes. Surprisingly, you don’t need a high-powered computer; I used a basic laptop, and it ran smoothly. </p>
                    
                <p>One limitation in VR is movement— I think that the default walking motion could cause motion sickness. I found using the simpler navigation worked better but you need to change to that mode in the app headset. Teleport options exist but require coding, so it’s simpler to build smaller areas to reduce walking.

                <h4>Snap lens studio</h4>
                
                <p>Snapchat has potential as an AR engagement tool, but implementation needs careful planning. The marker system works well—you can have multiple markers and view objects from different angles. However, only one object can be displayed at a time. Surface mode lets you place models, but they may drift, so they don’t stay fixed when moving around. </p>
                   
                <p>World mode is limited, with AR placement only available in three cities (including London), though new areas can be scanned with LiDAR on certain iPhones. There’s also a tap-to-place mode with occlusion, but adding different objects in one snap is tricky.</p>
                    
                <p>Projects take time to load, save, and import, but many formats are supported, and it handles multiple objects well. Objects scanned in workshops could be added to AR, though updating content live would require a clear plan and a dedicated person, as it’s slower than Roblox. </p>
                    
                <p>Projects save locally and can be shared privately among devices with the same login. Published projects allow for multiple collaborators, which could work well in workshops. Tutorials are mostly for older versions, so learning requires some trial and error, but it’s fairly easy to pick up. Knowing some coding would expand its potential further.</p>

                <h4>Reality Composer</h4>
                <p>This is an iOS app so it can only be used on an iPhone or iPad—it’s very easy to use. There’s an occlusion mode so models can interact with surroundings. However, placing objects in AR mode is tricky, as their positions aren’t fixed to the real world. This means they could shift if someone else opens the project, making it challenging for group use. Setting up carefully and keeping the app open is essential to avoid starting over.</p>
                <p>The object capture mode is good; it captures objects more accurately than other apps I have used, even allowing you to flip them to capture all sides. It also focuses on the object itself without picking up the surrounding area. Not all iPhones allow you to scan objects so you would need to check if your one does. </p>

                <h4>Adobe Aero</h4>
                <p>Aero didn’t work quite the way I’d hoped when I was testing it. I didn’t find the surface anchoring very stable, and the image anchor only supports one image and requires a direct view; the model disappears if you view it from an angle.</p>

                <p>On the plus side, Aero is user-friendly, with a gentle learning curve and easy tutorials. It allows on-the-go scene updates, which could be useful in workshops. It supports animations and various file imports (3D, 2D, audio). </p>

                <p>I found that Aero worked best for placing models at specific locations using latitude and longitude, allowing accurate placement in real-world settings. However, I found that it can be unpredictable, which may lead to frustration in a workshop setting where the focus should be on collaboration, not troubleshooting technology.</p>
